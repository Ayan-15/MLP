Finding Architecture for Multilayer Perceptron - Given a data set - 
the program formats data and prepares training data sets, validation data sets and test data sets. 

Based on the performance of the data sets, the architecture can be modified to find out the number of nodes in the hidden layer.

This project basically classifies a given dataset into required no. of classes. 
The program developed in C language is an automated system which at first trains the given dataset then it validates the set 
(using validation set which is a subset of the original data set), if required it increases the no. of nodes in hidden layer automatically and 
again trains it-until it finally validates correctly. Then the program finally determines 
the correct architecture and thus finally tests architecture using test set
(another subset of original data set) and determines the final error of the architecture.
